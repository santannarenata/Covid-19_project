# Coronavirus Analysis

## Group project 03
Members: Renata Sant'Anna, Cara Roberts, Hayden Buss, Kabao Xiong and Nick Sain

### Goal

Our main goal was to create data vizualization as maps and plots to show current Covid-19 cases around the world and progression by country. We've created a GeoMap with the most current data possible. The map layers would have the default as the total confirmed cases by country, but also the total recovered cases by country, and the total deaths by country.

Also, we've created a time series plot that shows the confirmed cases by country from the first date available through the most recent date in the dataset. Just insert the name of the country to see the progression overtime.
